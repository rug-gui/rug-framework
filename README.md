# R.U.G. Framework

<hr>

Note: Current build of RUG is being developed at [T-Framework](https://github.com/rug-gui/T-framework)


### Why R.U.G.?

As a developers, we constantly work on providing user with the best experience. And often to get that best experience users have to go through cumbersome processses like in case of a Windows Update which might block functioning of your app in an instance, but now to get your software to work they would need to download new exe build from store or somewhere you published and to provide better experience you need to implement an upgrade mechanism. RUG does this for you out of the box from your first ever rug project.

  Even we know how difficult it sometimes can get while migrating to a new framework for your projects, so RUG integrates directly into your earlier projects that you've created.

R.U.G is orignally desiged as a layer above your OS and your app's code, that reduces friction, and provides clean and optimized code to native OS API's all while enhancing developer experience, so you can focus on your code while we worry about the deployment.
